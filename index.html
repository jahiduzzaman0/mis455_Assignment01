        <h1>Peraghraph-1</h1>
        <p>The War of Independence of Bangladesh in 1971 was a significant event in the history of Bangladesh. Prior to
            1971, Bangladesh was part of Pakistan and was known as East Pakistan. However, tensions between East and
            West Pakistan had been growing for many years, fueled by cultural, linguistic, and economic differences.In
            March 1971, the Bangladesh Liberation War began when East Pakistani students, intellectuals, and political
            activists took to the streets to protest against the government of West Pakistan. The conflict escalated
            quickly, and West Pakistan responded with a brutal military crackdown. The Bangladesh Liberation War is
            estimated to have resulted in the deaths of between 300,000 and 3 million people, the vast majority of whom
            were civilians.</p>

        <p>Bangladesh and India share a long history of cultural, economic, and political connections. The two countries
            are neighboring nations and are bound by common linguistic and cultural ties. Historically, the region now
            known as Bangladesh was part of British India until 1947, when India gained independence from Britain and
            was divided into two countries: India and Pakistan. In 1971, East Pakistan declared independence from West
            Pakistan and became the independent country of Bangladesh.</p>
